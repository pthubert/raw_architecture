    <abstract>
      <t>Due to uncontrolled interferences, including the self-induced multipath fading, deterministic networking can only be approached on wireless links. The radio conditions may change -way- faster than a centralized routing can adapt and reprogram, in particular when the controller is distant and connectivity is slow and limited. RAW separates the routing time scale at which a complex path is recomputed from the forwarding time scale at which the forwarding decision is taken for an individual packet. RAW operates at the forwarding time scale. The RAW problem is to decide, within the redundant solutions that are proposed by the routing, which will be used for each individual packet to provide a DetNet service while minimizing the waste of resources.

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>
   Bringing determinism in a packet network means eliminating the statistical
   effects of multiplexing that result in probabilistic jitter and loss.
   This can be approached with a tight control of the physical resources to
   maintain the amount of traffic within a budgetted volume of data per unit of
   time that fits the physical capabilities of the underlying technology, and
   the use of time-shared resources (bandwidth and buffers) per circuit, and/or
   by shaping and/or scheduling the packets at every hop.

      </t>
      <t>
   Wireless networks operate on a shared medium where uncontrolled interference,
   including the self-induced multipath fading, adds another dimension to the
   statistical effects that affect the delivery. Scheduling transmissions can
   alleviate those effects by leveraging diversity in the spatial, time, code,
   and frequency domains, and provide a Reliable and Available service while
   preserving energy and optimizing the use of the shared spectrum.

      </t>
      <t>
   Deterministic Networking is an attempt to mostly eliminate packet loss for a
   committed bandwidth with a guaranteed worst-case end-to-end latency, even
   when co-existing with best-effort traffic in a shared network.
   This innovation is enabled by recent developments in technologies including
   IEEE 802.1 TSN (for Ethernet LANs) and IETF DetNet (for wired IP networks).
   It is getting traction in various industries including manufacturing, online
   gaming, professional A/V, cellular radio and others, making possible
   many cost and performance optimizations.
      </t>
      <t>
   The <xref target="RFC8655">"Deterministic Networking Architecture"</xref> is
   composed of three planes: the Application (User) Plane, the Controller Plane,
   and the Network Plane. Reliable and Available Wireless (RAW) extends DetNet
   to focus on issues that are mostly a co"ern on wireless links, and inherits
   the architecture and the planes. A RAW Network Plane is thus a Network Plane
   inherited by RAW from DetNet, composed of one or multiple hops of homogeneous
   or heterogeneous technologies, e.g. a Wi-Fi6 Mesh or one-hop CBRS access links
   federated by a 5G backhaul.
   </t><t>
   RAW networking aims at providing highly available and reliable end-to-end
   performances in a network with scheduled wireless segments. Uncontrolled
   interference and transmission obstacles may impede the transmission, and
   techniques such as beamforming with Multi-User MIMO can only alleviate some
   of those issues, so the term "deterministic" is usually not associated with
   short range radios, in particular in the ISM band. This uncertainty places
   limits to the amount of traffic that can be transmitted on a link while
   conforming to a RAW Service Level Agreement (SLA) that may vary rapidly.
   </t><t>
   The wireless and wired media are fundamentally different at the physical
   level, and while the generic <xref target="RFC8557">"Deterministic Networking
   Problem Statement"</xref> applies to both the wired and the wireless media,
   the methods to achieve RAW must extend those used to support time-sensitive
   networking over wires, as a RAW solution has to address less consistent
   transmissions, energy conservation and shared spectrum efficiency.

      </t>
      <t>
   The development of RAW technologies has been lagging behind deterministic
   efforts for wired systems both at the IEEE and the IETF. But recent efforts
   at the IEEE and 3GPP indicate that wireless is finally catching up at the
   lower layer and that it is now possible for the IETF to extend DetNet for
   wireless segments that are capable of scheduled wireless transmissions.

      </t>
      <t>
   The intent for RAW is to provide DetNet elements that are specialized for
   short range radios. From this inheritance, RAW stays agnostic to the radio
   layer underneath though the capability to schedule transmissions is assumed.
   How the PHY is programmed to do so, and whether the radio is single-hop
   or meshed, are unknown at the IP layer and not part of the RAW abstraction.

      </t>
      <t>
   Still, in order to focus on real-worlds issues and assert the feasibility of
   the proposed capabilities, RAW will focus on selected technologies that can
   be scheduled at the lower layers: IEEE Std. 802.15.4 timeslotted channel
   hopping (TSCH), 3GPP 5G ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC),
   IEEE 802.11ax/be where 802.11be is extreme high throughput (EHT), and L-band
   Digital Aeronautical  Communications System (LDACS).
   See <xref target="I-D.thubert-raw-technologies" format="default"/> for more.

      </t>
      <t>
   The establishment of a path is not in-scope for RAW. It may be the product of
   a centralized Controller Plane as described for DetNet. As opposed to wired
   networks, the action of installing a path over a set of wireless links
   may be very slow relative to the speed at which the radio conditions vary,
   and it makes sense in the wireless case to provide redundant forwarding
   solutions along a complex path and to leave it to the Network Plane to
   select which of those forwarding solutions are to be used for a given packet
   based on the current conditions.

      </t>
      <t>
   RAW distinguishes the longer time scale at which routes are computed from the
   the shorter forwarding time scale where per-packet decisions are made.
   RAW operates at the forwarding time scale on one DetNet flow over one path
   that is preestablished and installed by means outside of the scope of RAW.
   The scope of the RAW WG comprises Network plane protocol elements such as
   Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM)
   and in-band control to improve the RAW operation at the Service and at the
   forwarding sub-layers. RAW controls whether to use packet replication,
   Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ), Hybrid ARQ (HARQ) that includes Forward Error
   Correction (FEC) and coding, with a constraint to limit the use of redundancy
   as is really needed, e.g., when a spike of loss is observed.
   This is discussed in more details in <xref target="rou" format="default"/>
   and the next sections.

    <t>RAW reuses terminology defined for DetNet in the <xref target="RFC8655">
    "Deterministic Networking Architecture"</xref>, e.g., PREOF for Packet
    Replication, Elimination and Ordering Functions.
    </t><t>
    RAW also reuses terminology defined for 6TiSCH in <xref target=
    "I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture" format="default"/> such as the term Track.
    6TiSCH defined a Track as a complex path with associated PAREO operations.
    </t><t>
    RAW uses the term OAM as defined in <xref target="RFC6291"/>.
    </t>
    <t>
      RAW defines the following terms:
    </t>
    <dl>
        <dt>PAREO:</dt><dd>Packet (hybrid) ARQ, Replication, Elimination and
        Ordering. PAREO is a superset Of DetNet's PREOF that includes
        radio-specific techniques such as short range broadcast, MUMIMO,
        constructive interference and overhearing, which can be
        leveraged separately or combined to increase the reliability.
        </dd>
        <dt>Flapping:</dt><dd>In the context of RAW, a link flaps when the
        wireless connectivity is interrupted for short transient times,
        typically of a subsecond duration.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <t>
    In the context of the RAW work, Reliability and Availability are defined as
    follows:
    </t>
    <dl>
        <dt>Reliability:</dt><dd>Reliability is a measure of the probability
        that an item will perform its intended function for a specified
        interval under stated conditions. For RAW, the service that is expected
        is delivery within a bounded latency and a failure is when the packet
        is either lost or delivered too late.  RAW expresses reliability in
        terms of Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) and Maximum Consecutive
        Failures (MCF). More in <xref target="NASA"/>.</dd>
        <dt>Availability:</dt><dd>Availability is a measure of the relative
        amount of time where a path operates in stated condition, in other words
        (uptime)/(uptime+downtime). Because a serial wireless path may not be
        good enough to provide the required availability, and even 2 parallel
        paths may not be over a longer period of time, the RAW availability
        implies a path that is a lot more complex than what DetNet typically
        envisages (a Track).

      optimized forwarding decisions.

<t>
    To maintain the committed reliability at all times, a wireless host
    may use more than one Radio Access Network (RAN) in parallel.

    The RANs may be heterogeneous, e.g.,
    5G <xref target="I-D.farkas-raw-5g"/> and
    Wi-Fi <xref target="I-D.thubert-raw-technologies"/> for high-speed

<t> The idea is that the rest of the path to the destination(s) is protected
    separately (e.g., uses non-congruent paths) and/or is a lot more reliable,

      <name>High Availability Engineering Principles</name>

    <t>
    The reliability criteria of a critical system pervade through its elements,
    and if the system comprises a data network then the data network is also
    subject to the inherited reliability and availability criteria.
    It is only natural to consider the art of high availability engineering and
    apply it to wireless communicaitons in the context of RAW.
    </t>

    <t>
    There are three principles [pillars] of high availability engineering:
    </t>
     <ol spacing="compact">
     <li>elimination of single points of failure</li>
     <li>reliable crossover</li>
     <li>prompt detection of failures as they occur.</li>
     </ol>
     <t>
     These principles are common to all high availability systems, not just ones
     with Internet technology at the center.  Examples of both non-Internet and
     Internet are included.
    </t>


    <!--  333333333333333333333   -->

    <section numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Elimination of Single Points of Failure</name>

    <t>
    Physical and logical components in a system happen to fail, either as the
    effect of wear and tear, when used beyond acceptable limits, or due to a
    software bug.
    It is necessary to decouple component failure from system failure to avoid
    the latter.
    This allows failed components to be restored while the rest of the system
    continues to function.
    </t>
    <t>
    A non-Internet example is a standby generator available to power the system
    on failure of grid power. An Internet example is more than one communication
    several non-congruent link/path between nodes in a routable network.
    </t>
    <t>
    There is a rather open-ended issue over alternate routes -- for example,
    when links are cabled through the same conduit, they form a shared risk link
    group (SRLG), and will share the same fate if the bundle is cut. Just how
    distributed the infrastructure is a matter of discussion; there is no single
    right answer.
    It should be noted that intermediate nodes such as routers, switches, and
    the air medium itself can become single points of failure; this must be
    avoided, using link- and node-disjoint paths, and, for RAW, a high degree of
    diversity in the transmissions over the air.</t>

    <t>
    From an economics standpoint, executing this principle properly generally
    increases capitalization expense because of the redundant equipment. In a
    constrained network where the waste of energy and bandwidth should be
    minimized, an excessive use of redundant links must be avoided; for RAW this
    means that the extra bandwidth must only be used as a replacement of that
    lost due to a failure.

      <name>Reliable Crossover</name>

    <t>
    Having a backup equipment has a limited value unless it can be reliably switched into use within the down-time parameters.
    </t>
    <t>
    Using the backup generator example: one that does not automatically sense
    grid power failure, start itself, and place itself on line does not
    represent reliable crossover.
    </t>
    <t>
    Routers and IGPs execute reliable crossover continuously because the routers
    will use any alternate routes that are available <xref target="RFC0791"/>.
    This is due to the stateless nature of IP datagrams and the dissociation of
    the datagrams from the forwarding routes they take. The
    <xref target="RFC5714">"IP Fast Reroute Framework"</xref> analyzes mechanisms for fast failure detection and path repair for IP Fast-Reroute,
    and discusses the case of multiple failures and SRLG. Examples of FRR
    techniques include Remote Loop-Free Alternate <xref target="RFC7490"/> and
    backup label-switched path (LSP) tunnels for the local repair of LSP tunnels
    using RSVP-TE <xref target="RFC4090"/>.
    </t>
    <t>
    The DetNet PREOF leverages 1+1 redundancy whereby a packet is sent twice,
    over non-congruent paths. This avoids the gap during the fast reroute
    operation, but doubles the traffic in the network.
    In the case of RAW, the expectation is that multiple transient faults may
    happen in overlapping time windows, in which case the 1+1 redundancy with
    delayed reestablishment of the second path will not provide the required
    guarantees.
    The Data Plane must be configured with a sufficient degree of
    redundancy to select an alternate redundat path immediately upon a fault,
    without the need for a slow intervention from the controller plane.

    the importance of measurement for network protection, and provides abstract

    Using the art of SNMP, the above described backup generator would include an
    SNMP agent that can report the status of the generator (get messages) on
    demand, and report changes in status (e.g. startup, amount of fuel in the
    tank) (trap messages).

    Those measurements are needed in the context of RAW to inform the controller
    and make the long term reactive decision to rebuild a complex  path. But RAW
    itself operates in the Network Plane at a faster time scale. To act on the
    Data Plane, RAW needs live information from the Operational Plane , e.g.,
    using <xref target="RFC5880">Bidirectional Forwarding Detection</xref>
    and its variants (bidirectional and remote BFD) to protect a link, and
    OAM techniques to protect a path.

    The terms Reliaility and Availability are defined for use in RAW in
    <xref target="terms"/> and the reader is invited to read
    <xref target="NASA"/>
    for more details on the general definition of Reliability.
    Practically speaking a number of nines is often used to indicate the
    reliability of a data link, e.g., 5 nines indicate a
    Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) of 99.999%.
    </t>
    <t>
    This number is typical in a wired
    environment where the loss is due to a random event such as a solar particle
    that affects the transmission of a particular frame, but does not affect the
    previous or next frame, nor frames transmitted on other links. Note that the
    QoS requirements in RAW may include a bounded latency, and a packet that
    arrives too late is a fault and not considered as delivered.
    </t>
    <t>
    For a periodic pattern such as an automation control loop, this number is
    proportional to the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF).
    If a single fault can have dramatic consequences, then the MTBF is the
    expression of the chances that an unwanted event occurs. In data networks,
    this is rarely the case. Packet loss cannot never be fully avoided and the
    systems are built to resist to one loss, e.g., using redundancy with Retries
    (HARQ) or Packet Replication and Elimination (PRE), or, in a typical control
    loop, by linear interpolation from the previous measuremnents.
    </t>
   <t>
    But the linear interpolation method can not resist to multiple consecutive
    losses, and a high MTBF is desired as a guarantee that this will not happen,
    IOW that the losses-in-a-row can be bounded. In that case, what's really
    desired is a Maximum Consecutive Failures (MCF). If the number of losses in
    a row passes the MCF, the control loop has to abort. Engineers that build
    automated processes may use the network reliability expressed in nines or as
    an MTBF to provide an MCF, e.g., as described in section 7.4 of
    <xref target="RFC8578"/>.

      <name>Reliability in the Context of RAW</name>
    <t>
    In contrast with wired networks, errors in transmission are the predominent
    source of packet loss in wireless networks. The root cause may be of
    multiple origins:
    </t>
    <dl>
    <dt>Multipath Fading:</dt><dd>
    <t>A destructive interference by a reflection of the original signal.
    </t>
    <t>A radio signal may be received directly
    (line-of-sight) and/or as a reflection on a physical structure (echo).
    The reflections take a longer path and are delayed by the extra distance
    divided by the speed of light in the medium. Depending on the frequency, the
    echo lands with a different phase which may add up to (constructive
    interference) or destroy the signal (destructive interference).
    </t>
    <t>
    The affected frequencies depend on the relative position of the sender, the
    receiver, and all the reflecting objects in the environment.
    A given hop will suffer from multipath fading for multiple packets in a
    row till the something moves that changes the reflection patterns.
    </t>
    </dd>
    <dt>Co-channel Interference:</dt><dd>
    <t>
    Energy in the spectrum used for the transmission confuses the receiver.
    </t>
    <t>
    The wireless medium itself is a Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) for nearby
    users of the same spectrum, as an interference may affect multiple co-channel
    transmissions between different peers within the interference domain of the
    interferer, possibly even when they use different technologies.
    </t>
    </dd>
    <dt>Obstacle in Fresnel Zone:</dt><dd>
    <t>
    The optimal transmission happens when the Fresnel Zone between the sender
    and the receiver is free of obstacles.
    </t>
    <t>
    As long as a physical object (e.g., a metallic trolley between peers) that
    affects the transmission is not removed, the quality of the link is affected.
    </t>
    </dd>
    </dl>
    <t>
    In an environment that is rich of metallic structures and mobile objects, a
    single radio link will provide a fuzzy service.
    </t>
    <t>
    Transmission errors are typically not independent, and their nature and
    duration are unpredictable; as long as a physical object (e.g., a metallic
    trolley between peers) that affects the transmission is not removed, or as
    long as the interferer (e.g., a radar) keeps transmitting, a continuous
    stream of packets will be affected.
    </t>
    <t>
    The key word to combat losses is diversity. A single packet may be sent at
    different times over different paths that rely on different radio frequencies
    and different PHY technologies, e.g., narrowband vs. spread spectrum. It is
    typically retried a number of times in case of a loss, and if possible the
    retries should again vary all possible parameters. Each form of diversity
    combats a particular cause of loss and use of diversity must be maximised to
    optimize the PDR.

      <t>
   A prerequisite to the RAW work is that an end-to-end routing function
   computes a complex sub-topology along which forwarding can happen between a
   source and one or more destinations. For 6TiSCH, this is a Track. The concept
   of Track is specified in the 6TiSCH Architecture
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture" format="default"/>.
   Tracks provide a high degree of redundancy and diversity and enable DetNet
   PREOF, end-to-end network coding, and possibly radio-specific abstracted
   techniques such as ARQ, overhearing, frequency diversity, time slotting, and
   possibly others.
      </t>
      <t>
   How the routing operation computes the Track is out of scope for RAW.
   The scope of the RAW operation is one Track, and the goal of the RAW
   operation is to optimize the use of the Track at the forwarding timescale
   to maintain the expected service while optimizing the usage of constrained
   resources such as energy and spectrum.
      </t>
      <t>
   Another prerequisite is that an IP link can be established over the radio
   with some guarantees in terms of service reliability, e.g., it can be relied
   upon to transmit a packet within a bounded latency and provides a guaranteed
   BER/PDR outside rare but existing transient outage windows that can last from
   split  seconds to minutes. The radio layer can be programmed with abstract
   parameters, and can return an abstract view of the state of the Link to help
   forwarding decision (think DLEP from MANET). In the layered approach, how the
   radio manages its PHY layer is out of control and out of scope. Whether it is
   single hop or meshed is also unknown and out of scope.

   With DetNet, the end-to-end routing can be centralized and can reside
   outside the network. In wireless, and in particular in a wireless mesh, the
   path to the controller that performs the route computation and maintenance
   expensive in terms of critical resources such as air time and energy.
      </t><t>
   Reaching to the routing computation can also be slow in regards to the speed
   of events that affect the forwarding operation at the radio layer. Due to the
   cost and latency to perform a route computation, the controller plane is not
   expected to be sensitive/reactive to transient changes. The abstraction of a
   link at the routing level is expected to use statistical operational metrics
   that aggregate the behavior of a link over long periods of time, and
   represent its availability as shades of gray as opposed to either up or down.

      <t>
   In the case of wireless, the changes that affect the forwarding decision can
   happen frequently and often for short durations, e.g., a mobile object moves
   between a transmitter and a receiver, and will cancel the line of sight
   transmission for a few seconds, or a radar measures the depth of a pool and
   interferes on a particular channel for a split second.
      </t>
      <t>
   There is thus a desire to separate the long term computation of the route and
   the short term forwarding decision. In such a model, the routing operation
   computes a complex Track that enables multiple Non-Equal Cost Multi-Path
   (N-ECMP) forwarding solutions, and leaves it to the Data Plane to make
   the per-packet decision of which of these possibilities should be used.
      </t>
      <t>
   In the case of wires, the concept is known in traffic engineering where an
   alternate path can be used upon the detection of a failure in the main path,
   e.g., using OAM in MPLS-TP or BFD over a collection of SD-WAN tunnels. RAW
   formalizes a forwarding time scale that is an order(s) of magnitude shorter
   than the controler plane routing time scale, and separates the protocols
   and metrics that are used at both scales.
   Routing can operate on long term statistics such as delivery
   ratio over minutes to hours, but as a first approximation can ignore flapping.
   On the other hand, the RAW forwarding decision is made at packet speed, and
   uses information that must be pertinent at the present time for the current
   transmission.

   <t>
    The  <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture">"6TiSCH Architecture"</xref>
    introduces the concept of Track a a possibly complex path with the PAREO
    functions operated within.</t>

    <t>
    A simple track is composed of a direct sequence of reserved hops to ensure
    the transmission of a single packet from a source node to a destination node
    across a multihop path.
    </t>
    <t>
        A Complex Track is designed as a directed acyclic graph from a source node
        towards a destination node to support multi-path forwarding, as introduced in
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture">"6TiSCH Architecture"</xref>.
        By employing PRE functions
        <xref target="RFC8655"/>, several paths may be computed, and these paths
        may be more or less independent. For example, a complex Track may
        branch off and rejoin over non-congruent paths (branches).
    </t>

    <t>
        Some more details for Deterministic Network
        PRE techniques are presented in the following Section.
    </t>

</section>
      <!--Wireless Tracks-->


    <section numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Source-Routed vs. Distributed Forwarding Decision</name>
      <t>
   Within a large routed topology, the route-over mesh operation builds a
   particular complex Track with one source and one or more destinations; within
   the Track,
   packets may follow different paths and may be subject to RAW forwarding
   operations that include replication, elimination, retries, overhearing and
   reordering.
      </t>
      <t>
   The RAW forwarding decisions include the selection of points of replication
   and elimination, how many retries can take place, and a limit of validity for
   the packet beyond which the packet should be destroyed rather than forwarded
   uselessly further down the Track.
      </t>
      <t>
   The decision to apply the RAW techniques must be done quickly, and depends on
   a very recent and precise knowledge of the forwarding conditions within the
   complex Track. There is a need for an observation method to provide the RAW
   Data Plane with the specific knowledge of the state of the Track for
   the type of flow of interest (e.g., for a QoS level of interest). To observe
   the whole Track in quasi real time, RAW will consider existing tools such as
   L2-triggers, DLEP, BFD and in-band and out-of-band OAM.
      </t>
      <t>
   One possible way of making the RAW forwarding decisions is to make them all
   at the ingress and express them in-band in the packet, which requires new
   loose or strict Hop-by-hop signaling. To control the RAW forwarding operation
   along a Track for the individual packets, RAW may leverage and extend known
   techniques such as DetNet tagging, Segment Routing (SRv6) or BIER-TE such as
   done with
   <xref target="I-D.thubert-bier-replication-elimination" format="default"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
   An alternate way is to enable each forwarding node to make the RAW forwarding
   decisions for a packet on its own, based on its knowledge of the expectation
   (timeliness and reliability) for that packet and a recent observation of the
   rest of the way across the possible paths within the Track. Information about
   the service should be placed in the packet and matched with the forwarding
   node's capabilities and policies.
      </t>
      <t>
   In either case, a per-flow state is installed in all intermediate nodes to
   recognize the flow and determine the forwarding policy to be applied.

    <t>
        In a nutshell, PRE establishes several paths in a
        network to provide redundancy and parallel transmissions to
        bound the end-to-end delay to traverse the network.
        Optionally, promiscuous listening between paths is possible, such that the nodes
        on one path may overhear transmissions along the other path.
        Considering the scenario shown in <xref
        target="fig_ladder"/>,
        many different paths are possible for S to reach R. A simple
        way to benefit from this topology could be to use the
        two independent paths via nodes A, C, E and via B, D, F.  But
        more complex paths are possible by interleaving transmissions
        from the lower level of the path to the upper level.
    </t>


    <t>
         PRE may also take advantage of
         the shared properties of the wireless medium to compensate for the
         potential loss that is incurred with radio transmissions.
         For instance, when the source sends to A, B may listen also and
         get a second chance to receive the frame without an
         additional transmission. Note that B would not have to listen if it
         already received that particular frame at an earlier timeslot in a dedicated transmission towards B.
<!-- [->] This is assuming some sort of implicit knowledge in B. Not sure if this is  -->
<!-- possible without specific signaling.   -->
<!-- [GP] Yes, we may need additional 6P transactions from the source to B, or  -->
<!-- multicast 6P transaction from the source to both A and B. However, this  -->
<!-- need to be discussed and defined. We have referred to these requirements in the "Requirements Related to Cell Reservation" section in the upcoming version.  (DONE) -->

    <t>
        The PRE model can be implemented in both centralized and distributed scheduling
        approaches.
        In the centralized approach, a Path Computation Element (PCE) scheduler calculates
        the routes and schedules the communication among the nodes along a circuit such
        as a Label switched path.
        In the distributed approach, each node selects its route to the destination,
        typically using a source routing header.
        <!-- This specification focuses on the distributed path diversity. -->
        In both cases, at each node in the paths, a default parent and alternative parent(s) should
        be selected to set up complex tracks.
    </t>



    <t>
        In the following Subsections, all the required operations
        defined by PRE, namely, Alternative Path Selection, Packet Replication, Packet
        Elimination and Promiscuous Overhearing, are described.
    </t>



<section title="Packet Replication">

    <t>
        The objective of PRE is to provide deterministic networking properties:
        high reliability and bounded latency.
        To achieve this goal, determinism in every hop of the forwarding paths MUST be
        guaranteed.
<!-- NM - Not clear what is a level. Not clear to me if it is a "should be"-->
<!-- GP: is it clear now? -->
        By employing a Packet Replication procedure, each node forwards
        a copy of each data packet to multiple parents: its Default Parent (DP) and multiple Alternative Parents (APs).
        To do so, each node (i.e., source and intermediate node) transmits the
        data packet multiple times in unicast to each parent.
        For instance, in <xref target="fig_replication"/>, the source node S is
        transmitting the packet to both parents, nodes A and B, in two different
        timeslots within the same TSCH slotframe. An example TSCH schedule is shown in <xref target="fig_replication_schedule"/>.
        Thus, the packet eventually obtains parallel paths to the destination.

<section title="Packet Elimination">

    <t>
        The replication operation increases the traffic load in the
        network, due to packet duplications.  Thus, a Packet Elimination
        operation SHOULD be applied at each RPL DODAG level to reduce
        the unnecessary traffic. To this aim, once a node receives the
        first copy of a data packet, it discards the subsequent copies. <!-- see Figure X
        (TODO) --> Because the first copy that reaches a node is the
        one that matters, it is the only copy that will be
        forwarded upward. Then, once a node performs the Packet Elimination operation,
        it will proceed with the Packet Replication operation to forward the packet
        toward the RPL DODAG Root.

        Considering that the wireless medium is broadcast by nature, any neighbor of
        a transmitter may overhear a transmission.
        By employing the Promiscuous Overhearing operation, a DP and some AP(s) eventually have more
        chances to receive the data packets.
        In <xref target="fig_overhearing"/>, when node A is transmitting to its DP
        (node C), the AP (node D) and its sibling (node B) may decode this data packet as
        well.
        As a result, by employing corellated paths, a node may have multiple
        opportunities to receive a given data packet.
        This feature not only enhances the end-to-end reliability but also it reduces the
        end-to-end delay and increases energy efficiency.
